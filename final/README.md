## Tic Tac Toe

This is a simple version of Tic Tac Toe that I built to learn Pygame.

### To do

* Option to create new game when the last game is finished.
* Allow players to specify board size.
* Allow players to change the colors of the board.
* Add the computer as a player and allow players to choose an AI opponent.
* Create an application instead of needing to run it via command line.
