    # Put your solution code here.

    # Step 1.
    # Change this line to initialize fib_seq to a 2x1 TensorFlow
    # tensor *Variable* with the initial values of 0.0 and 1.0.
    # Hint:
    # You'll need to make sure you specify a 2D tensor of shape 2x1,
    # not a 1D tensor. See fib_matrix above (a 2x2 2D tensor) to guide
    # you.

    # Change this line to multiply fib_matrix and fib_sequence using tf.matmul()\
    next_fib = tf.matmul(fib_matrix, fib_sequence)

    # Step 3.
    # Change this line to assign the result back to fib_sequence using tf.assign()
    assign_op = tf.assign(fib_sequence, next_fib)

    # ---- SOLUTION END ###

    # Finally, initialize all the step and run
